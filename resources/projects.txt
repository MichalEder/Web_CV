{"Project": "LibrApp", "Tech": "Python, Django, HTML, CSS, SQlite", "Description": "LibrApp is a web-based application designed for managing book collections and user profiles. The system allows users to add, edit, and delete book details (title, author, publication year, etc.), search for books by title, author, or subtitle, register new accounts, and maintain user profiles. LibrApp also integrates with the Google Books API for streamlined book searches via ISBN and to automatically populate book data. Planned features include tracking loaned books, book ratings, and comment sections for each book entry.", "Link": "https://datarios.pythonanywhere.com/Librapp/index", "Image": "webapp.jpg"}
{"Project": "FolderSync", "Tech": "Python", "Description": "This Python script provides a folder synchronization tool, ensuring that a designated replica folder mirrors the contents of a source folder. It accomplishes this by comparing the folders, detecting new, deleted, or modified files/directories, and then copying, removing, or overwriting items in the replica accordingly.  The script also logs all synchronization actions and allows you to optionally set an interval for automatic re-synchronization, providing a convenient way to maintain consistency between folders.", "Link": "Not deployed - https://github.com/MichalEder/FolderSync", "Image": "cli.png"}
{"Project": "SudokuSolver", "Tech": "Python", "Description": "This Python script tackles Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.  It works via a command-line interface \u2013 you provide the Sudoku puzzle as input, and the script attempts to solve it. If successful, the solved puzzle is printed; if not, the script alerts you that the puzzle is unsolvable. The solver can handle varying difficulty levels and provides clear output along with informative error handling for invalid input.", "Link": "Not deployed - https://github.com/MichalEder/SudokuSolver", "Image": "cli.png"}
{"Project": "WebCV", "Tech": "Python, Streamlit", "Description": "What started as a Streamlit library experiment quickly (hardly 10h of work) evolved into a functional prototype for a dynamic web CV. This includes a public-facing profile and a private admin section for managing skills, projects, and hobbies. While still a work in progress (developed \"on the fly\" with some compromises like using JSON .txt files instead of database), this prototype showcases the potential of Streamlit for personalized content management and rapid web development.\n", "Link": "https://michaleder.streamlit.app/", "Image": "webapp.jpg"}
