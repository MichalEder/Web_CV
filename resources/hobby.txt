{"Hobby": "Boardgames", "Description": "So, I'm really into tabletop games lately, especially the cooperative ones. There's something awesome about working together with friends to beat the game instead of competing. It's a totally different kind of fun \u2013 figuring out strategies, helping each other out, and celebrating victories together. It's a blast! We should try one sometime!", "Image": "games.png"}
{"Hobby": "PC games", "Description": "I'm seriously hooked on resource management games - Factorio, Rimworld, Guild 2...the works! There's something awesome about building a whole world from nothing.  Tweaking production lines, balancing resources...it's the perfect brain-teaser for me, and things are always changing.  Love that kind of challenge! It's totally my guilty pleasure - I start playing, and hours just vanish!", "Image": "pc_games.png"}
{"Hobby": "Tabletop miniatures painting", "Description": "I've recently started getting into painting tabletop miniatures. It's a whole new world! It's kind of relaxing, focusing on the details and bringing these little figures to life. I'm apparently a natural at painting tabletop miniatures...if you consider painting yourself a sign of talent! I'm new to this, and let's just say my fingers, hands, and occasionally my forehead get a lot more colorful than the actual figures. I swear, sometimes I look like I battled a rainbow and lost. But hey, it's all part of the fun, right? Plus, I figure the more I practice, the less I'll resemble a walking art project. At least, that's what I'm hoping!", "Image": "painting.jpg"}
